Container patterns in Kubernetes refer to best practices and design principles for creating, managing, and orchestrating containers within a Kubernetes cluster. These patterns help ensure that your containerized applications run efficiently, are scalable, maintainable, and highly available. Here are some common container patterns in Kubernetes:

1. **Single Container Pattern**:
   - The simplest pattern is to run a single container per pod. This is suitable for applications that consist of a single process or service.

2. **Sidecar Pattern**:
   - In this pattern, you run an additional container (sidecar) alongside the main application container in the same pod. The sidecar container enhances or extends the functionality of the main application. For example, a sidecar container could handle logging, monitoring, or security-related tasks.

3. **Ambassador Pattern**:
   - The ambassador pattern involves using a proxy container (ambassador) to access external services or resources on behalf of the main application container. This helps abstract the complexity of connecting to external dependencies.

4. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - Similar to the ambassador pattern, the adapter pattern uses a container to adapt or modify the interface of an existing service to make it compatible with the application. This can be useful when integrating with legacy systems.

5. **Init Container Pattern**:
   - Init containers are run before the main application container starts. They are typically used for setup, configuration, or data preparation tasks. For example, an init container might populate a shared volume with configuration files.

6. **Multi-Container Pod**:
   - Kubernetes allows you to run multiple containers within the same pod. Each container in the pod shares the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost. This pattern is useful for closely coupled applications that need to share resources.

7. **Sidecar-Init Hybrid Pattern**:
   - This pattern combines the init container and sidecar container patterns. It involves running a sidecar container that handles tasks like log collection or metrics while also using an init container for setup and configuration tasks.

8. **Ad Hoc Containers Pattern**:
   - Ad hoc containers are temporary containers that can be run in the same pod for debugging or maintenance purposes. They provide a way to troubleshoot issues without interfering with the main application container.

9. **Stateful Application Pattern**:
   - For stateful applications like databases, you can use StatefulSets to ensure that each pod has a unique identity and stable network identity. This pattern is crucial for data consistency and availability.

10. **Batch Job Pattern**:
    - When running batch processing jobs, you can create pods with containers specifically designed for the batch job, and then manage the lifecycle of these pods using Jobs or CronJobs.

11. **Builder Pattern**:
    - In this pattern, you use a builder container to build application artifacts (e.g., binaries, packages) and then copy the resulting artifacts to a smaller runtime container. This reduces the image size of the runtime container.

12. **Proxy Pattern**:
    - A proxy container can be used to handle incoming traffic, implement rate limiting, authentication, or other network-level tasks before routing requests to the main application container.

These container patterns help you design and deploy applications in Kubernetes in a way that maximizes flexibility, scalability, and maintainability while meeting specific requirements and constraints. Depending on your application's needs, you may use one or more of these patterns in your Kubernetes environment.
